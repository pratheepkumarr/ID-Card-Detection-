# YOLO Object Detection for ID Card
Overview
This project demonstrates an application of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection and distance measurement of ID cards using a webcam. The application utilizes a pre-trained YOLO model to detect ID cards, draw bounding boxes around detected objects, and calculate the distance from the camera based on the size of the detected object.

Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Uses the YOLO model to detect ID cards in real-time from a webcam feed.
Bounding Boxes: Draws bounding boxes around detected ID cards with confidence scores.
Distance Calculation: Computes the approximate distance of the ID card from the camera based on the size of the detected object.
Dynamic Labels: Displays confidence percentage and distance information on the video feed.
Customizable Thresholds: Allows adjustment of confidence thresholds for detection accuracy.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for scripting.
Ultralytics YOLO: YOLO model for object detection.
OpenCV: Library for image processing and video capture.
NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git](https://github.com/pradeeshkumareu/Object-detection--ID-Card.git)
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy
Download YOLO Model:

Download the pre-trained YOLO model (id_card_v5.pt) from the provided source or train your own model and place it in the project directory.
Run the Script:

Execute the script using Python.

View Results:

The webcam feed will open in a window displaying detected ID cards, bounding boxes, confidence scores, and calculated distances.
Configuration
Confidence Threshold: Adjust the confidence_threshold variable in the script to filter detections based on confidence level.
Camera Calibration: Modify focal, pixels, and width variables if needed to calibrate distance calculations based on your camera setup.
How It Works
Video Capture: Captures video frames from the webcam.
Object Detection: Processes each frame with the YOLO model to detect ID cards.
Bounding Boxes: Draws bounding boxes around detected objects with confidence scores.
Distance Calculation: Calculates the distance of the detected object from the camera using the width of the bounding box.
Display Information: Overlays labels and distance information on the video feed.
Usage
Detect ID Cards: Point your webcam towards an ID card to detect and measure its distance.
Adjust Parameters: Modify the script to adjust detection thresholds and calibration settings according to your needs.
